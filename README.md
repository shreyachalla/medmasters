# medmasters
Democratizing data analytics for doctors by empowering them to query databases with natural language. MedMasters is a tool that harnesses the Google Gemini Pro LLM to allow SQL queries to be performed with simple natural language inputs, democratizing the capacity to gain insights from large and complex databases, and this is especially useful for critical environments such as hospitals where providers do not have the bandwidth to execute elaborate SQL queries, but need to understand important medical data.
